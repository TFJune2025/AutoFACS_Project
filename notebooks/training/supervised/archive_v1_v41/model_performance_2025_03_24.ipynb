    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training vs. Validation Loss:**\n",
    "   - **V4:** The extremely low training loss (0.0049) paired with a low validation loss (~0.5856) suggests that the model learned the training data very well and generalized effectively.\n",
    "   - **V6:** The training loss in V6 decreases well (from 0.6748 to 0.0448), but the validation loss increases to 1.2181. This gap indicates that the model is overfitting—the model is fitting the training data too perfectly but not generalizing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accuracy:**\n",
    "   - **V4:** Achieves a final accuracy of ~87.3%.\n",
    "   - **V6:** Caps at ~78.5%, which is considerably lower, meaning the improvements in V6 (such as the stronger augmentations and hyperparameter adjustments) did not yield better generalization.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Potential Reasons for V6 Underperformance:**\n",
    "   - **Excessive Aggressive Augmentation:**  \n",
    "     The stronger augmentations (e.g., higher rotation, larger color jitter, random resized crop) might be distorting critical facial features, leading the model to learn non-representative patterns.\n",
    "   - **Learning Rate / Warmup Mismatch:**  \n",
    "     The choice of a lower learning rate (3e-5) combined with an increased warmup ratio (0.2) might be affecting how quickly the model converges, potentially causing underfitting or early overfitting.\n",
    "   - **Regularization Differences:**  \n",
    "     If dropout or weight decay is insufficient in V6, the model might overfit the augmented training data, resulting in a lower validation performance.\n",
    "   - **Dataset Characteristics:**  \n",
    "     V6 might be training on a more challenging or diverse version of your dataset, making it inherently harder to generalize—even if the model fits the training data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recommendations for Improving V6**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few targeted improvements for V6, focusing on balancing generalization and preventing overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tweak Augmentation Strength:**\n",
    "   - **Recommendation:** Slightly reduce the aggressiveness of your augmentations. For instance, decrease the degree of rotation or the intensity of color jitter.\n",
    "   - **Rationale:** Overly aggressive augmentations can distort facial features critical for correct expression recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adjust Learning Rate and Warmup:**\n",
    "   - **Recommendation:** Consider experimenting with a learning rate between 3e-5 and 5e-5, and test a warmup ratio of 0.1 instead of 0.2.\n",
    "   - **Rationale:** A slightly higher learning rate or shorter warmup period may help the model converge better on your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhance Regularization:**\n",
    "   - **Recommendation:** Increase weight decay (e.g., from 0.01 to 0.02) or add dropout layers (if the model architecture allows) in the classification head.\n",
    "   - **Rationale:** This will further discourage overfitting by penalizing large weights and introducing noise during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement Early Stopping with Increased Patience:**\n",
    "   - **Recommendation:** Increase the early stopping patience to 2–3 epochs.\n",
    "   - **Rationale:** This gives the model a little more time to potentially recover from fluctuations in validation loss rather than stopping too early.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Perform Cross-Validation or Use a Larger Validation Set:**\n",
    "   - **Recommendation:** Consider performing k-fold cross-validation or increasing the validation split.\n",
    "   - **Rationale:** A more robust evaluation can help ensure that improvements are consistent and that the model isn’t just overfitting a small subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Thoughts**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **V4** remains the best performing model based on our previous results.\n",
    "- **V6** shows promise in terms of reducing training loss but suffers from higher validation loss and lower accuracy, pointing to overfitting and/or overly aggressive augmentation/regularization.\n",
    "- **Implementing the above improvements gradually and monitoring validation performance** should help move V6’s performance closer to or even surpass V4.\n",

    "Below is a detailed explanation of one effective strategy to make your independent model more robust and better adapted to your target domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strategy Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that your independent model (the one saved via `model.save_pretrained(...)` and reloaded from your V4 folder) performs well on your new, diverse dataset, you can take two key actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Robust Fine-Tuning**  \n",
    "   - **Gradually unfreeze the backbone**: Freeze the backbone (the pre-trained ViT layers) initially so that only the classification head trains. This lets the head quickly adapt to your target data.\n",
    "   - Then, gradually unfreeze parts of the backbone while lowering the learning rate for those layers. This prevents drastic changes in the pre-trained features while allowing fine-tuning for domain-specific nuances.\n",
    "   - **Use appropriate hyperparameters**: A lower learning rate (e.g. 3e-5) and a moderate warmup ratio (e.g., 0.1–0.2) can help the model converge smoothly without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reinitialize the Classification Head**  \n",
    "   - If your target domain differs significantly from the original training domain, you can reinitialize the final classifier layer. This gives the classifier a “fresh start” so it doesn’t carry over any bias from the original pretraining.\n",
    "   - Reinitializing can be done using standard weight initialization techniques (e.g., Xavier uniform initialization).\n",
    "   - This is especially important if you’ve changed the number of classes or if you suspect that the original classifier’s weights are suboptimal for your new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implementation Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Reinitialize the Classification Head**\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model has an attribute like `model.classifier` (common in many Hugging Face image classification models), you can reinitialize it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch.nn as nn\n",
    "import torch.nn.init as init\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option 1: If your classifier has a reset_parameters() method:\n",
    "if hasattr(model.classifier, 'reset_parameters'):\n",
    "    model.classifier.reset_parameters()\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Option 2: Manually reinitialize weights\n",
    "    init.xavier_uniform_(model.classifier.weight)\n",
    "    if model.classifier.bias is not None:\n",
    "        init.zeros_(model.classifier.bias)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This step ensures that the final classification layer is reset to random weights that can be better tuned on your target dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Robust Fine-Tuning via Gradual Unfreezing**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Freeze the Backbone Initially:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Freeze the backbone (all parameters except classifier)\n",
    "   for param in model.vit.parameters():\n",
    "       param.requires_grad = False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train Only the Classification Head:**\n",
    "   Train your model for a few epochs (using your Trainer) so that the classifier head learns quickly on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gradually Unfreeze the Backbone:**\n",
    "   After initial training:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Unfreeze the backbone gradually\n",
    "   for param in model.vit.parameters():\n",
    "       param.requires_grad = True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Optionally, you might want to use a lower learning rate for these layers. This can be done by defining different learning rates for different parameter groups when initializing your optimizer (if you’re using a custom training loop) or by adjusting your training strategy if using the `Trainer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adjust Learning Rate and Warmup:**\n",
    "   Ensure that the learning rate is reduced (e.g., set to 3e-5) and adjust the warmup ratio to give the model time to adapt:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   training_args = TrainingArguments(\n",

    "Your V4 model—if it's achieving around 87% accuracy on validation—is generally strong enough for automated dataset sorting. Here are some key points to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automated Sorting Feasibility:**  \n",
    "   With ~87% accuracy, the model can serve as an effective initial sorter. It will correctly label most images into the 7 categories it was trained on. However, note that about 13% of the images may be misclassified, so a subsequent manual review or quality control step might be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Domain Considerations:**  \n",
    "   If the new photos differ significantly from the training data (e.g., different lighting, pose, quality), the accuracy might drop. In that case, sorting may still be useful for bulk categorization, but expect more errors which you'll need to correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confidence Thresholds:**  \n",
    "   You can also consider using the model’s output confidence scores. For images with low confidence, you could flag them for manual review, which improves overall sorting quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cost and Efficiency:**  \n",
    "   Automating the sorting process with your V4 model can save significant time and GPU cost compared to manual sorting, even if you need a later manual cleanup for edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the V4 model is a practical tool for initial automated sorting, but ensure you have a review process in place for misclassified examples.\n",

    "### **Explanation of Key Sections**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configuration and Directory Setup:**  \n",
    "   - `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` defines the minimum probability required to automatically sort an image.\n",
    "   - Input and output folder paths are defined, and folders are created for each label as well as for manual review.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Loading:**  \n",
    "   - The independent model and its processor are loaded from your saved folder (`vit_final_independent_V4`).\n",
    "   - The model is set to evaluation mode and moved to GPU if available.\n",
    "   - The model’s `id2label` mapping is used to convert numeric predictions to class names.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classification Function (`classify_image`):**  \n",
    "   - Loads an image, ensures it’s in RGB.\n",
    "   - Preprocesses it using the processor.\n",
    "   - Performs inference and applies softmax to obtain the confidence scores.\n",
    "   - Returns the predicted label and its confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Image Sorting Loop:**  \n",
    "   - Iterates through all files in the input folder.\n",
    "   - Classifies each image and checks if its confidence is above the threshold.\n",
    "   - Moves the image to the appropriate folder or to a manual review folder if confidence is low.\n",
    "\n",

    "That’s a strong move. Using your V4 model to **auto-sort the lightly curated CelebA face dataset** into labeled emotion categories (e.g., angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral) has serious potential — **but it also comes with trade-offs** that need careful planning. Here’s a detailed breakdown of **how this will affect training performance, dataset quality, and model robustness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **What Happens When You Auto-Sort 111,000 CelebA Faces**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ **Pros — Why This Could Be Powerful**\n",
    "1. **Major Data Volume Boost → Stronger Generalization**  \n",
    "   - Your current FER+CK+JAFFE combo is ≈37K images.\n",
    "   - CelebA will 3× your training data size. More data = better generalization, especially in deep learning where overfitting is a risk.\n",
    "   - Expressions in-the-wild (CelebA) will diversify your training data beyond lab-controlled expressions in FER/CK/JAFFE.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exposure to Realistic, High-Resolution Faces**  \n",
    "   - CelebA is mostly higher-quality, varied lighting/angles — something missing from most academic emotion datasets.\n",
    "   - Adding it will help the model perform better in real-world applications (e.g., video, mobile, wild photography).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Better Fine-Tuning Base for Domain Adaptation**  \n",
    "   - You’ll end up with a custom dataset more aligned with your deployment domain (e.g., webcams, surveillance, user photos).\n",
    "   - Future fine-tuning on even smaller domain-specific datasets will become much more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ **Cons — Where You Need to Be Cautious**\n",
    "1. **Label Noise: Prediction ≠ Truth**  \n",
    "   - Since the labels are generated by the model itself, **errors will propagate**.\n",
    "   - If V4 is wrong on subtle emotions (e.g., fear vs. surprise), you’ll reinforce incorrect patterns.\n",
    "   - This is *especially risky if you train future models directly on these labels without filtering*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Imbalance Will Get Worse**  \n",
    "   - V4 is likely to predict **happy** or **neutral** far more often than **disgust** or **fear**.\n",
    "   - You’ll end up with a highly skewed dataset, unless you track distribution and apply balancing (e.g., downsampling or weighting).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feedback Loop Risk (Model teaches itself its own mistakes)**  \n",
    "   - If you keep re-training a new model on its own prior predictions, you might amplify biases (especially if no human-verified labels intervene).\n",
    "   - This is similar to self-training in semi-supervised learning — which can be powerful *if done carefully*.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ **Best Practices for Using Auto-Sorted CelebA**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how to **maximize the value** while minimizing risk:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. ✅ **Use Confidence Threshold + Manual Sampling**\n",
    "   - Stick to high-confidence predictions only (e.g., ≥ 0.85).\n",
    "   - For low-confidence predictions, either discard or queue for manual review.\n",
    "   - This will reduce noise and increase the reliability of your auto-labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. 📊 **Track Class Distributions After Sorting**\n",
    "   - After sorting, print the count per emotion class.\n",
    "   - If there’s severe imbalance, **apply class-balancing techniques** before training:\n",
    "     - Downsample dominant classes.\n",
    "     - Use class weights in your loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. 🧪 **Treat Auto-Sorted CelebA as a Pseudo-Label Dataset**\n",
    "   - Don’t blindly merge it with your original FER/CK/JAFFE dataset.\n",
    "   - Instead:\n",
    "     - **Fine-tune on CelebA**, but then **re-fine-tune on the clean dataset**.\n",
    "     - This is similar to **curriculum learning** — start broad, refine narrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. 🧼 **Audit a Random Subset**\n",
    "   - Manually check 200–300 samples per class from the sorted CelebA to validate accuracy.\n",
    "   - If accuracy is ≥90% for high-confidence predictions, it’s safe to scale it up.\n",
