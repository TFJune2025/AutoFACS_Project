    "Adding the LFW headshots can be very useful, but there are some important considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Robustness:**  \n",
    "   - **Diverse, in‑the‑wild data** from LFW can help your model generalize better. Even if it doesn’t push accuracy to 100% on a controlled test set, it will likely perform more reliably on real-world images.\n",
    "   - More diversity in the training data often improves the model’s resilience to variations (lighting, pose, background) which is critical for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accuracy Trade-Off:**  \n",
    "   - Achieving near 100% accuracy is rare, especially when you introduce challenging, \"wild\" images. Adding LFW may lower raw accuracy on a held‑out set (if that set is drawn from easier images), but it improves real-world performance.\n",
    "   - In other words, while your measured accuracy might drop compared to training only on controlled datasets, the model becomes more robust and practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cost Efficiency:**  \n",
    "   - Manually sorting LFW headshots is a cost-effective way to expand your dataset rather than using more expensive GPU time for additional training iterations.\n",
    "   - More high-quality data can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "For money saving and to build a more robust model, it is **worth finishing the LFW sorting and integrating those photos** with your existing FERCKJA dataset. This will help your model learn a wider variety of facial expressions in different conditions, which is crucial for real-world performance—even if it might make near-perfect accuracy an unrealistic target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like any further guidance on how to integrate and balance the datasets?"
